# Junit4---Math-Operation-Test---Basic
Perform unit tests on functions/procedures

This test is carried out on 3 functions of mathematical operations, namely addition, subtraction, and power.
However, in this case I did a test build with 2 passes and a failure. Where do you think the error is? Come on, try with the code that I provide.

This test uses a simple OOP concept, namely the use of Object, Abstraction, Encapsulation, and Polymorphism
